## Introduction

Current Maintainer: GSAâ€™s IT Modernization division at <dccoi@gsa.gov>

Federal IT, facilities, procurement, and sustainability professionals have expressed a need for:
- Concise, centralized information about how to procure green IT products and services.
- Real world examples on how to systematically incorporate and integrate green IT products and services.

The purpose of this effort is to align on common standards across government, industry, and academia on sustainable IT acquisition nomenclature, as demonstrated through sustainable data centers. It provides a proposed standard lexicon of procurement terms and associated recommendations for sustainable IT products and services across power production, power consumption, people, processes, and materials.
